And typical me, I volunteered without thinking about how much work I already have on my plate but really happy I decided to do it. </div>
                    <div class="description one">I gave my lightning talk today on the difference between object and block storage. I know quite a dry topic but i tried to make it interesting and made lots of pictures on my slides to try and keep peoples attention. And it went really well. People seemed to really enjoy it. I really have to get back to doing them on my youtube channel too.</div>
