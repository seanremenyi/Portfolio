I ws getting pretty proud of my site too, was showing off my pictures and felt like it was all going good. Then decided to show some people in my cohort and our other lecturer Jamal who pointed out as good my site was looking, from an outside perspective, it was very photography focused. And at the end of the day this is for IT recruiters, not photographers.</div>
