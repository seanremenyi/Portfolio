                <div class="par one">My name is Sean Remenyi, I'm an aspiring developer at Coder Academy in Melbourne. I'm 30 and from Montreal, Canada. </div>
                <div class="par two">I've spent a lot of my adult life travelling and working as a chef. Been through most of Europe, Asia, North America and South America. I've been a chef at the same time dabbling in cuisines ranging from latin American and Southeast Asian to pub grub and European. This is what acctually allowed me to immigrate here to Australia.</div>
                <div class="par three">I've grown up around computers all my life but only until this past year, really decided to look into coding. I'm really enjoying it as someone who just really enjoys building things. I'm enjoying building applications and have even started a youtube channel this year explaining tech concepts. This year my motto is consume less, create more. I know I'll go far as a developer as someone who really enjoys collaborating, developing and creating. It's gotten me far in my chef career and I know I can apply my same mindset and attitude towards this new career.</div>
          
                <div class="par four">My hobbies include cooking, reading, playing guitar and now photography. I have been taking pictures with an old Minolta film camera that my uncle left me. I love getting out of town and taking a few nature pictures with it. All background images on this site we're taken by me.</div>
