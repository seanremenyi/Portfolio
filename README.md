##This is my portfolio website. 
It was created to showcase my skills in web design as well as my personality. It's purpose is to help with future employment. 
It's made with simplicity in mind. Focusing on the main features and having them work well and showcase my photography with the backgrounds.
There is no URL or github link because we haven't learned to deploy yet and it should be noted that the SRI's hash was using the URL generated by the web preview in Ed.
This might mean the style sheet used to create the hash might have had code injected by Ed and the site can then only be viewd in Ed


#Features/Functionality include:
-Poppins sans-serif imported from google fonts.
-Nav bar that underlines the page you are on.
-Sleek social media icons that link to my profile pages on each page.
-Responsive design to view different layouts depending on screensize.
-Subresource Integrity to avoid tampering with my code.
-Contact me page that can open mail client with my e-mail.
-Background pictures with a blue overlay effect.
********note that I had my pictures edited to go from 4x6 to 16x9 and the designer misunderstood and added the blue overlay effect.
    I would like to include the code however that i was originally using for the effect because it took me a long time to figure out and was proud for learning it.
    I ran out of time in my presentation so couldn't bring it up then either (I also wanted to keep my code clean so didn't just want to comment it out).

   ```
   .html {
        background-image: url("4.jpg"); 
        background-position: center;
        background-repeat: no-repeat;
        background-size: cover;
        height:100%;
        padding:0;
        margin:0;
}
    .overlay {
        background-color: blue;
        opacity: 0.8;
        height:100%;
        position: fixed;
        padding:0;
        margin:0;
    }
 ```
-Extra html pages for full size pictures for my blog.
-Links embedded into text on my resume and projects page.

And here is a screenshot of my wireframe. For full wireframes of the site please refer to the wireframes in the docs/ folder.

Here is also an early draft of the website that was later scraped because i thought the design was too loud and wasn't as geared to my target audience.
![old site preview](src/img/screenshot4.png)

My target audience is IT professionals, recruiters and perspective employers. It is my hope that the design, features and code displayed on this website will help land me future employment.
I used a tech stack which include HTML, CSS and git for version control.

Thank you
