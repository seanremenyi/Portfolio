This is my portfolio website. 
It was created to showcase my skills in web design as well as my personality.
It's made with simplicity in mind. Focusing on the main features and having them work well and showcase my photography with the backgrounds.

Features include:
#-Poppins sans-serif imported from google fonts.
-Nav bar that underlines the page you are on.
-Sleek social media icons that link to my profile pages on each page.
-Responsive design to view different layouts depending on screensize.
-Subresource Integrity to avoid tampering with my code.
-Contact me page that can open mail client with my e-mail.
-Background pictures with a blue overlay effect.
    *note that I had my pictures edited to go from 4x6 to 16x9 and the designer misunderstood and added the blue overlay effect.
    I would like to include the code however that i was originally using for the effect because it took me a long time to figure out and was proud for learning it.
    I ran out of time in my presentation so couldn't bring it up then either (I wanted to keep my code clean so didn't just want to comment it out).
    set html height:100% then
   
    .overlay {
    background-color: blue;
    opacity: 0.8;
    width:100%;
    height:100%;
    position: fixed;
    padding:0;
    margin:0;
    }
    '''
-Extra html pages for full size pictures for my blog.
-Links embedded into text on my resume and projects page.
-Cv.pdf linked on my resume page.
