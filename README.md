## This is my portfolio website. 
It was created to showcase my skills in web design as well as my personality. It's purpose is to help with future employment. 
It's made with simplicity in mind. Focusing on the main features and having them work well and showcase my photography with the backgrounds.
There is no URL or github link because we haven't learned to deploy yet and it should be noted that the SRI's hash was using the URL generated by the web preview in Ed.
This might mean the style sheet used to create the hash might have had code injected by Ed and the site can then only be viewd in Ed

I am unable to add them as seperate files do to being at 100% of the user@sahara space (unable to even do my final commit).

Here is also an early draft of the website that was later scraped because i thought the design was too loud and wasn't as geared to my target audience.
